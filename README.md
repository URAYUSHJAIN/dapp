## 🧱 What is a dApp?

A **dApp (Decentralized Application)** is a web application that interacts with a smart contract deployed on a blockchain network like Ethereum. Unlike traditional apps, dApps:

* Are **trustless** and run on **immutable smart contracts**
* Enable **peer-to-peer interactions** without centralized control
* Often use wallets like **MetaMask** for identity and transactions
* Store data on **decentralized storage** (e.g., IPFS, Filecoin)

This project is a **full-stack dApp** built using:

* 🔵 **Frontend:** React + Vite + TailwindCSS
* ⚙️ **Backend (Smart Contracts):** Solidity + Hardhat
* 🦊 **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask + Ethers.js
* 🧾 **Optional:** IPFS/Filecoin, Anon DigiLocker, or any Web3 service

## 💡 Use Case

> *Example (Customize for your project):*
> `Shayoga` is a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users can create and fund social campaigns. To ensure trust, campaign creators must verify their identity via DigiLocker before launching campaigns. All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

## 🔗 Key Features

* 📦 Campaign creation with identity verification
* 💰 Secure crypto contributions
* 🔍 Transparent donation tracking
* 🌐 Runs on Ethereum testnets (e.g., Goerli, Sepolia)
* 🗃️ IPFS integration for storing campaign data/images
